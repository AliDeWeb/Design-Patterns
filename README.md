# 🐦‍🔥 Design Pattens In Ts - Principle and Rules

### By Ali Moradi [AliDeWeb](https://github.com/AliDeWeb)

### Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. **Encapsulation** – Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some details.
2. **Abstraction** – Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality.
3. **Inheritance** – Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class to promote code reuse.
4. **Polymorphism** – Enabling multiple classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, allowing method overriding and dynamic behavior.

### **SOLID Principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

### **Other Important Principles:**

Apart from SOLID, other key design principles in OOP include:

- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Avoid duplication by abstracting reusable code.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** – Keep code simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)** – Don’t implement features unless absolutely necessary.
- **Law of Demeter (LoD)** – Objects should only interact with closely related objects to reduce coupling.

These principles ensure maintainability, scalability, and clean code.
