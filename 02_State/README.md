# State Pattern 🎭🔄

The **State Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. Instead of using `if-else` or `switch` statements, the pattern delegates state-specific behavior to individual state classes.

## 🛠️ Components

1. **Context** 🏗️: The object that changes its behavior based on its current state.
2. **State Interface** 🔄: Defines a common interface for all states.
3. **Concrete States** 🎭: Different implementations of the state interface.

## 🔍 Why Use It?

- **Eliminates Complex Conditionals** ❌🔀
- **Encapsulates State-Specific Behavior** 🔐
- **Promotes Code Maintainability** 🛠️

## 📝 Example Use Cases

- **Traffic Light System 🚦**: Changing behavior based on red, yellow, and green states.
- **Media Player 🎵**: Play, pause, stop states.
- **Order Processing System 📦**: States like pending, shipped, delivered, canceled.

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Better Code Organization** 📂: Each state has its own class.
- **Scalability** 🚀: Easily add new states without modifying existing logic.
- **Encapsulation** 🔒: The state transition logic is hidden from the main object.

## 🚀 Conclusion

The **State Pattern** is ideal when an object’s behavior depends on its internal state. By **separating state-specific behavior**, it makes the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to extend. 🌟
